## react live

[react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live)

* A production-focused playground for live editing React components
* a nice tool to display a snippet of code itself and instantly render that code in a live editor

### sample code

live editor to render `react-atlas` (using `create-react-app`)

```JS
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import {
  LiveProvider,
  LiveEditor,
  LiveError,
  LivePreview
} from 'react-live'
import { Dropdown, Option } from "react-atlas";
import '../node_modules/react-atlas/lib/atlasThemes.min.css';

const theDropDown = 
(`<Dropdown name="basicDropdown" id="basicDropdown">
<Option value="true" text="Yes" />
<Option value="false" text="No" />
</Dropdown>`);

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <LiveProvider code={theDropDown} scope={{Dropdown, Option}}>
          <LiveEditor />
          <LiveError />
          <LivePreview />
        </LiveProvider>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

## server-side rendering

### The Benefits of Server Side Rendering Over Client Side Rendering
https://medium.com/walmartlabs/the-benefits-of-server-side-rendering-over-client-side-rendering-5d07ff2cefe8

* two benefits
    * Performance benefit for our customers
    * Consistent SEO performance

> The main difference is that for SSR your server’s response to the browser is the HTML of your page that is ready to be rendered, while for CSR the browser gets a pretty empty document with links to your javascript.

### Client-side rendering vs. server-side rendering

> Best of both worlds
To get the best of both worlds, you can do the following:

> Use server-side rendering for the first page load.
> Use client-side rendering for all subsequent page loads.

###  next.js
* Next.js is a lightweight framework for static and server‑rendered applications.

#### Next.js is not what you may think it is
https://medium.com/the-ideal-system/next-js-is-not-what-you-may-think-it-is-8423172e7401

> The biggest feature of Next.js is that it’s not a backend. It’s closer to what @getify calls a middle-end. A universal rendering frontend.

> The best architecture that’s coupled with this is that Next.js queries data services in getInitialProps. REST micro-services, APIs and GraphQL are great complements to this architecture.

> In other words next.js’s scope is to UI-rendering, while abstracting away the client/server distinction. If you need “proper” backend logic, such as a database or an accounts server, you should keep that in a separate server application.

next.js is (probably) best for:

> A minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications

## linked list algorithm problems

### 876. Middle of the Linked List	
https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/

* time: O(n)
* space: O(1)
* **fast and slow pointer** for this "middle" type of linked list problem
* iterative

```python
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        fast = slow = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        return slow
```

### 203. Remove Linked List Elements
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/description/

* time: O(n), two pass
* space: O(1)
* first check the head, then check remaining nodes
* general **two pointer** solution for linked list
* iterative

```python
    def removeElements(self, head, val):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type val: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if head:
            # check head first
            while head and head.val == val:
                head = head.next
            # check other nodes
        if head:
            first, second = head, head.next
            while second:
                if second.val == val:
                    first.next = second.next
                else:
                    first = first.next
                second = second.next

        return head
```

### 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/description/

* time: O(n), two pass
* space: O(1)
* iterative
* general **two pointer** solution for linked list

```python
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if head:
            cur_val = head
            first, second = head, head.next
            while second:

                    first = first.next
                second= second.next
        return head
```

### 328. Odd Even Linked List

* time: O(n)
* space: (1)
* iterative
* two pointers for odd and even, temp to store even head
* build odd and even linked list separately and finally connect odd.next with evenHead 
* **build separately, combine later**

```python
def oddEvenList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if head:
            odd, even, even_head = head, head.next, head.next
            while even and even.next:
                # build odd and even linked lists separately
                odd.next = odd.next.next
                even.next = even.next.next
                odd = odd.next
                even = even.next
            # connect odd and even linked list
            odd.next = even_head
        return head
